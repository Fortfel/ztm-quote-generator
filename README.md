# TypeScript Project with Vite & Tailwind CSS

This project is built using TypeScript with Vite as the build tool, Tailwind CSS for styling, ESLint for code linting, and TypeDoc for generating documentation.

It's a simple project that uses the ZenQuotes API to generate quotes.

If during development quotes generation is not working on localhost, you need to go to
[https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo)
first and activate it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   cd your-project
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Provide any necessary configuration (e.g., API keys, environment variables, etc.) in the `.env` file.

4. Setup in your IDE ESLint and Prettier for the best development experience.

## Development

### Running the Project

To start the development server with hot reloading:

```
npm run dev
```

To build the project for production:

```
npm run build
```

To preview the production build locally:

```
npm run preview
```

### Linting the Code

ESLint is used to ensure code quality and enforce style guidelines.
Run the following commands to lint your TypeScript files:

```
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

### Generating Documentation

This project uses **TypeDoc** to generate API documentation from the TypeScript code.
The documentation will be generated in the docs folder:

```
npm run docs
```

To continuously generate documentation as you code, use the watch mode:

```
npm run watch:docs
```

## Scripts

The project includes several npm scripts to automate tasks:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with TypeScript watching and Vite
- `npm run vite`: Runs Vite development server
- `npm run build`: Builds the project for production
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build locally
- `npm run watch:tsc`: Watches TypeScript files for changes
- `npm run lint`: Lints the TypeScript code using ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix`: Automatically fixes any fixable linting errors
- `npm run docs`: Generates documentation using TypeDoc
- `npm run watch:docs`: Watches for changes and regenerates TypeDoc documentation

## Vite Configuration

The project uses Vite for fast development and optimized builds. The configuration can be found in `vite.config.ts`. It includes:

- Path aliases from tsconfig.json
- Tailwind CSS integration
- Legacy browser support
- BrowserSync for multi-device testing

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is configured in `tailwind.config.ts` and is used for styling the application. The project includes additional Tailwind plugins:

- @tailwindcss/forms
- @tailwindcss/typography

## ESLint Configuration

ESLint is set up to lint TypeScript code. You can find the configuration in the `.eslintrc.json` file.

## TypeDoc Configuration

TypeDoc is configured in the `package.json` file under the `typedocOptions` section.
It generates API documentation based on your TSDoc comments in the source code.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
Make sure your code passes all lint checks and that the documentation is up to date.
